## CI/CD Workflow

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

* **Trigger:** The workflow is automatically triggered on every `push` to the `main` branch **if (and only if)** the `index.html` file is modified.
* **Action:** It builds the static site and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, making it live on GitHub Pages.

This project demonstrates a practical understanding of CI/CD principles for automated deployment.
